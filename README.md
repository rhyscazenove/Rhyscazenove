ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Rhys Cazenove

I'm a software engineering leader and AI practitioner based in London. Over the past 15+ years, I've built scalable digital platforms across health, culture, and media â€” from AI-assisted internal tooling at the Natural History Museum to enhanced reading experiences for authors like Barack Obama and Hilary Mantel.
