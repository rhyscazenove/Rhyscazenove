# 👋 Hello, I'm Rhys Cazenove

I'm a software engineering leader and AI practitioner based in London. Over the past 15+ years, I've built scalable digital platforms across health, culture, and media — from AI-assisted internal tooling at the Natural History Museum to enhanced reading experiences for authors like Barack Obama and Hilary Mantel.

Today, I'm focused on building **accountable, auditable, and human-centred AI workflows** — systems that empower people, not replace them.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus Areas

- **AI hygiene and governance**: Prompt injection mitigation, structured audit metadata, and persona orchestration
- **Observability for GenAI workflows**: Tracing with OpenTelemetry, monitoring via Grafana/Loki
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Secure, context-rich systems with human feedback loops
- **Ethical automation**: AI that augments human intelligence, not replaces it

🧠 Past Highlights
	•	🦕 Natural History Museum: Led replatforming of 25+ apps to AKS, CI/CD pipelines, built AI chatbot integrated into MS Teams, implemented observability patterns and prompt versioning.
	•	📚 Enhanced Editions: Co-founded a startup that pioneered enhanced iPhone books; won multiple UX awards and worked with major authors.
	•	📺 Comedy Central (Viacom): Led product dev for The Daily Show, South Park and more; scaled SEO traffic 150%, built video infrastructure and analytics dashboards.
	•	🥣 Brothee Organic Foods: Founded an ethical food company, ran ecommerce + retail logistics, and led sustainability practices aligned with B-Corp standards.

💬 Values & Philosophy
	•	Human-first AI: I believe AI should support humans, not impersonate them. I’m currently exploring ways to make agentic workflows safer, more transparent, and more useful to real teams.
	•	Results over rituals: Strong delivery culture matters more than process dogma. I favor tight feedback loops, clear ownership, and thoughtful defaults.
	•	Purpose-driven work: Whether at a museum, food startup, or AI lab, I gravitate toward work that improves wellbeing and builds systems people can trust.

📖 What I’m Reading / Exploring
	•	The Lethal Trifecta – Simon Willison
	•	Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines for GenAI
	•	Nilenso’s AI-assisted coding reflections
