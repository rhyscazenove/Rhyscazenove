👋 Hello, I'm Rhys Cazenove

I'm a software engineering leader and AI practitioner based in London. Over the past 15+ years, I've built scalable digital platforms across health, culture, and media — from AI-assisted internal tooling at the Natural History Museum to enhanced reading experiences for authors like Barack Obama and Hilary Mantel.

Today, I'm focused on building **accountable, auditable, and human-centred AI workflows** — systems that empower people, not replace them.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus Areas

- **AI hygiene and governance**: Prompt injection mitigation, structured audit metadata, and persona orchestration
- **Observability for GenAI workflows**: Tracing with OpenTelemetry, monitoring via Grafana/Loki
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Secure, context-rich systems with human feedback loops
- **Ethical automation**: AI that augments human intelligence, not replaces it
